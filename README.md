# udacity-suse-scholarship
These are my notes for the 2 month challenge on Cloud Native Application Architecture course. The format of the daily check-ins must follow this format:
1. What did I work on yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What issues are blocking my progress?

For the study teams, we post using this format:
1. What did your Study Team work on or participate in last week?
2. What are your plans for this coming week? 
3. Are you facing any challenges or blockers?

Day 42:
1.  Yesterday I studied for my Okta exam. I submitted the final tally of #st_canada members who completed the course.
2.  Today I took the Okta Certified Professional exam and passed. I'll get the total breakdown via email soon but I believe I was very close to not passing. Hate DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) style of question for exams. I attended the end party Zoom call and posted my updates to my GitHub repo.
3.  Got some help on a possible docker image type for golang alpine go-helloworld app on an RPi 3. Just need some time to try it out.

1.  Looking back at your original motivation and goals, how did you do?
I did fairly well. I saved my original motivation and goals on my Github blog so I can refer back to it. I said that I was all over the place with my plans wanting to finish my Udacity/Bertelsmann AI Program Manager nanodegree, study for the AWS ML phase 1 challenge, get AWS Solutions Architect recertified, and get Okta Certified Professional certified before fall 2021 semester starts at Georgia Tech. I was able to get my AI Program Manager certificate and just passed my Okta Certified Professional exam tonight.

2.  Were you on track for what you expected and hoped for? (If not, what would you want to try next time to get there?)
It's already August next week and my classes at Georgia Tech start August 23, 2021 which leaves me with less that 3 weeks to finish the AWS ML phase 1 challenge and get my AWS Solutions Architect recertification. Slack definitely contributed to my procrastination and having too many tabs open on my browser. I'll try and have one app or tab open at one time to stay focused.

3.  What helped you succeed and stay motivated/succeed thus far? (Did anything surprise you about this process?)
Nothing surprise me this time around as it is my second scholarship challenge. Although Slack was my downfall, it was also my saving grace as I used it along with LinkedIn messenger to stay in touch with current and past Udacity scholar to stay motivated. Socializing my successes and/or failures on Slack kept me honest and accountable, which helped me complete 3 out of 5 goals I wanted to complete at the start of this challenge.


Day 41:
1.  Yesterday I booked my Okta exam and lesson 11, skipped the Okta Udemy course. What a waste of $35 on a course, the trainer does not know how to teach. Instead of useless Udemy course I went through all the Okta materials and practiced on oktapreview.com tenant.
2.  Today I counted all members who have not completed the course and on the worst case, there are 40/64 who still have not finished. Continued studying for my Okta exam. Posted my updates to my GitHub repo.
3.  Got some help on a possible docker image type for golang alpine go-helloworld app on an RPi 3. Just need some time to try it out.

Day 40:
1.  Yesterday I finished lesson 11, skipping lesson 12 (python), finished lesson 13 of Okta Udemy course. I also took the free sample exam from the site. I started updating our tracking list to figure out who in #st_canada is done with Cloud native course by scouring through slack any updates from members.
2.  Today I will book my Okta exam and continue studying. I submitted an EasyPoll to #st_canada channel to get a sense of who has finished the course so we can win the highly coveted Study Team Competition award for this coming Wednesday July 28. Posted my updates to my GitHub repo.
3.  Still no help on finding correct docker image type for golang alpine app that will work on an RPi arm.

Day 39:
1.  Yesterday I finished lesson 3 fron the Okta course on Udemy.
2.  Today I finished lesson 9 from the Okta course. Posted my updates to My GitHub repo.
3.  Still no help on finding correct docker image type for golang alpine app that will work on an RPi arm.

Day 38:
1.  Yesterday I met with @Barry.Pratt for our Study Buddy meetup. I finished lesson in Users for the Okta course on Udemy.
2.  Today I continue on the Okta course. Posted my updates to My GitHub repo.
3.  Still no help on finding correct docker image type for golang alpine app that will work on an RPi arm.

Day 37:
1.  Yesterday I finished AWS ML lesson 2.5. Spent some time troubleshooting golang alpine images that will run on my RPi 3. I also participated in a 2 hour Okta Professional Certification Exam Prep webinar. Received a $50 voucher good until September.

Day 36:
1.  Yesterday I finished AWS ML lesson 2.4 and started lesson 3 exercises again but on Raspberry Pi 3.

1. How are you doing so far in this course and community in relation to your original motivation?
Since the start, I have been all over the place, excited to drink in all these scholarships and certifications (AI Program Manager ND, AWS ML challenge, AWS recertification, Okta certification) before fall 2021 semester starts. Nothing has changed, I am still all over the place, still excitedly drinking in all the learnings.

2. Are you on track/what you expected and hoped for? If not, what can you do to get there?
Not where I wanted to be. Slack seems to contribute to my procrastination and don't know how to get around that. I need to do my own daily_scrum for the other items I am trying to complete outside of this foundations course but because I cannot post here, those are falling behind. With regards to this course, I am ahead of schedule.

3. What has helped you succeed and stay motivated/succeed thus far?
My study team #st_canada has provided the hand-holding needed to get past demo exercises from lesson 3 and 4. Priceless to have such talented scholars there.
