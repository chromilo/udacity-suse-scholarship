# udacity-suse-scholarship
These are my notes for the 2 month challenge on Cloud Native Application Architecture course. The format of the daily check-ins must follow this format:
1. What did I work on yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What issues are blocking my progress?

For the study teams, we post using this format:
1. What did your Study Team work on or participate in last week?
2. What are your plans for this coming week? 
3. Are you facing any challenges or blockers?
