These are my notes for the 2 month challenge on Cloud Native Application Architecture course

Day 10: 
1.	Yesterday I made it to lesson 3.12 KuberConfig walkthrough, working to install Kind cluster.
2.  Today I installed Kind cluster in Windows and K3s inside the VirtualBox VM running Linux, completing lesson 3.16. 
3.	I couldn't connect to my Linux VM from my Windows 10 host to be able to test launching the apps from browser. I bridged the VM network adapter and can ping the VM guest from my Windows 10 host but I am not able to get to ports 6111 or 6112 ports. I got it to work with Kind cluster installed to my Windows 10 computer so I can move forward.
